This experimental evaluation of an LSTM, GCN--LSTM, and STGCN for spatiotemporal traffic forecasting also served as an introduction to optimizing training through Stochastic Gradient Descent. As such, the notebook uses the SWA orchestrator found here: https://github.com/HB53492/SWA-Orchestrator-for-SGD. Furthermore, training and evaluation was performed with the Huber Loss function, with varying degrees of success.
